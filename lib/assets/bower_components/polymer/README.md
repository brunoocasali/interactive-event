# Polymer JS

This package simply provides the original polymer js sources, see
https://www.polymer-project.org/ for more information.

## Note about versions

This package follows the same versions as polymer js for clarity, but that does
mean that it may have breaking changes that are marked by non-breaking version
bumps. It is recommended that you constrain your versions to upper bounds that
have already been released and tested.

The exception to this rule is cherry picks which will be added as +x releases.
